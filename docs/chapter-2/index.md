# Chapter 2: Building Interactive Physical AI Systems

Building on the foundational concepts from Chapter 1, this chapter focuses on creating more interactive and complex Physical AI systems. You'll learn how to build systems that respond dynamically to their environment and interact with objects in simulated physical spaces.

## Overview
- Lesson 2.1: Environmental Perception in Physical AI
- Lesson 2.2: Dynamic Response Systems
- Lesson 2.3: Multi-Agent Physical Simulations
