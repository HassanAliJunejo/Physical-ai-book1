# Physical AI Book: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the Physical AI Book, a comprehensive resource for learning about Physical AI - the intersection of artificial intelligence and the physical world. This book is designed for beginners to intermediate learners who want to understand how AI systems can interact with and control physical environments.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical systems, creating AI agents that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the real world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital domains, Physical AI systems must deal with:

- Uncertainty in sensor data
- Real-time constraints
- Safety requirements
- Complex physical interactions

## Book Structure

This book is organized into chapters, each containing multiple lessons that follow the "Explain-Show-Do" format:

1. **Explain**: Conceptual explanations with analogies and visual aids
2. **Show**: Practical examples and code snippets with syntax highlighting
3. **Do**: Hands-on exercises with clear instructions

## Getting Started

Start with [Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI](/chapter-1/index) to build a strong foundation in the core concepts of Physical AI.

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Fundamental understanding of mathematics (calculus, linear algebra)
- Interest in robotics, physics simulations, or AI applications
