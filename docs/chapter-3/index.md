# Chapter 3: Perception and Sensing in Physical AI

Welcome to Chapter 3, where we explore one of the most fundamental aspects of Physical AI - how agents perceive and understand their environment through various sensor systems.

In this chapter, we'll cover:

- How Physical AI agents use different types of sensors to gather information about the world
- The process of converting raw sensor data into meaningful information
- Practical examples of sensor integration in Physical AI systems
- Hands-on exercises to simulate sensor-based decision making

Understanding perception systems is crucial for developing robots that can operate safely and effectively in the real world. Sensors serve as the connection between the digital intelligence of AI and the physical world it interacts with.

## Lessons in this Chapter:

- **Lesson 3.1**: How Physical AI Agents Perceive Their Environment Using Sensors - An introduction to the various sensor types used in Physical AI, how they work, and how the data is processed.
